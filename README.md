# webscraping!
##Introduction 
Web scraping is a powerful tool for collecting data across the web. In this project, I use Python to web scrape a novel and count the most common words. The goal is to answer the question, "What are the most common words in Mobey deck novel?" By analyzing the most frequent words in a novel, we can gain insight into its themes, characters, and plot.

For this project, I collected the data using Python's __requests__ library and extracted the relevant text using __BeautifulSoup__. I then used natural language processing techniques to remove common words such as "he", "they", "a", and "and". Finally, I used __Seaborn__ and __Matplotlib__ to visualize the results and answer the research question.

in any poject I first start with  question : 

for this project the question is " what are the most common words in x Novel"

2. Get you Data
 
    I will be using Python to collect the data, since the data is on the web the best and fastest way to collect it is by webscraping using python. python has a cool library called requests, that is prefect for this role.
 3. Wrangle the data.
    Python has many tools to wrangle data and such as pandas, numpy and more for this project I will be using BeautifulSoup as it helps extracting data from all HTML pages . also I used Natrual processing language to help remove common words  such as ( he, they , a , and ...)
    
 4. answer the question. 
 
   looking at long rows and number is tiring to the eye, so the best way to answer this question is by visualizing the data, and I'm using seaborn and matplotlib to answer this question
   
 5. Present your solution.
 
   below is alist of books with the most common words, I created a function that allows to remove commong words that might have been missed.
