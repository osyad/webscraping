# webscraping!
 
Web scraping is a powerful method for collecting data across the web. In this project, I use Python to web scrape a novel and count the most common words. The goal is to answer the question, "What are the most common words in Mobey deck novel?" By analyzing the most frequent words in a novel, we can gain insight into its themes, characters, and plot.

For this project, I collected the data using Python's __requests__ library and extracted the relevant text using __BeautifulSoup__. I then used natural language processing techniques to remove common words such as "he", "they", "a", and "and". Finally, I used __Seaborn__ and __Matplotlib__ to visualize the results and answer the research question.

# Steps taken during.

# 1. Ask Question
I started this project by asking a question which is "What are the most common words in Mobey deck novel?", this question is drived by the purpose of knowing the themes, characters, and plot of the novel.


# 2. Get you Data
 
I will be using Python library _Request_ to collect the data. __Requests__ is an awesome library and popular library that is used by giant tech comapnies such as netflex.  
it's easy to use and it provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests, making it easy for developers to send requests and receive responses from servers.
 
 3. Wrangle the data.
    Python has many tools for data wrangleing  such as pandas, numpy and more for this project I will be using BeautifulSoup as it helps extracting data from all HTML pages. also I used Natrual processing language to help remove common words  such as ( he, they , a , and ...)
    
 4. answer the question. 
 
   looking at many rows that contine texts or number is tiring to the eye, so the best way to answer this question is by visualizing the data, and I'm using seaborn and matplotlib to answer this question.
   
 5. Present your solution.
 
   below is a list of books with the most common words.
   I created a function that allows to remove commong words that might have been missed by the natural process language.
